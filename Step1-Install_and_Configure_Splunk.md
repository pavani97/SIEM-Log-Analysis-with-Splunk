### ⚙️ Steps to Install and Configure Splunk

#### Step 1: Download Splunk
Open Terminal and download Splunk using:

```bash
wget -O splunk-9.3.0-51ccf43db5bd-linux-2.6-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.3.0/linux/splunk-9.3.0-51ccf43db5bd-linux-2.6-amd64.deb"
```
Once the file is downloaded, verify it with:
```
ls -lh splunk-9.3.0-51ccf43db5bd-linux-2.6-amd64.deb
```

Then install Splunk using dpkg:
```
sudo dpkg -i splunk-9.3.0-51ccf43db5bd-linux-2.6-amd64.deb
```

⚠️ Note: If any dependency issues occur, fix them with:
```
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```
#### Step 2: Enable Splunk as a Service

Move to the Splunk installation directory:
```
cd /opt/splunk/bin

```
Accept the license agreement and enable Splunk to start automatically when the system boots:
```
sudo ./splunk enable boot-start --accept-license

```
Now, start the Splunk service:
```
sudo ./splunk start
```

## 🌐 Access Splunk Web Interface

Once Splunk is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://<your-server-ip>:8000
```

Example for local systems:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

Log in using the admin credentials you just created.

You should see the Splunk Web Dashboard, which allows you to search, add data, and configure your Splunk instance.

## 🧩 Verify Splunk Installation

After logging into Splunk Web, verify that Splunk is indexing internal logs correctly.

Go to Search & Reporting and run this SPL query:
```
index=_internal | stats count
```

If you receive a non-zero count, Splunk is working properly 🎉

## Manage Splunk Service (Optional Commands)

Start Splunk manually:
```
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
```

Stop Splunk:
```
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk stop
```

Restart Splunk:
```
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
```

Check Splunk status:
```
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk status
```

## 🚀 What’s Next?

Now that Splunk is installed and configured successfully, the next section — **Step 2: DNS Log Analysis** — will guide you through ingesting DNS logs into Splunk and analyzing them using SPL (Search Processing Language).  
You’ll learn how to extract fields, identify the most queried domains, find active source IPs, and detect unusual DNS activity that could indicate malicious behavior.
