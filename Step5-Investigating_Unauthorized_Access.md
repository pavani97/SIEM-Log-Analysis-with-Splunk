# Investigating Unauthorized Access Lab – Splunk  

## 🎯 Objective  
To learn how to search and analyze authentication logs using Splunk to:  
- Detect unauthorized access attempts.  
- Extract meaningful insights from fields like `user`, `src_ip`, and `status`.  
- Identify suspicious login behaviors that may indicate compromise.
